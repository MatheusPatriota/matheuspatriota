### Hello World I'm Matheus ðŸ‘‹

I am a student of Software Engineering  at Federal Institute of Pernambuco (IFPE) . I like to learn about new technologies, I've had experiences in mobile and web development, I like to create projects that challenge me, that develop my personal skills and increasingly improve my vision as a developer.

I am currently an intern at @Alest as a software developer.

âš¡ The world is even bigger out there, let's conquer it âš¡
